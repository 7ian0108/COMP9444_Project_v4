    "### 这是一个图像病症分类问题 而我为什么要在 DataLoader 中获取和加载良性或恶性病变信息\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 数据增强 (Data Augmentation)\n",
    "在数据中，同一个病变 (lesion_id) 可能对应多张图像。在模型训练时，将这些图像视为一个组来处理可以帮助数据增强。例如，如果一个良性病变有多张图像，这些图像的不同视角或拍摄条件能提供更多样本，帮助模型更好地学习和泛化。\n",
    "通过标记整个 lesion_id 组作为良性或恶性，可以确保数据增强时模型不会因单个图像的噪声或异常条件产生偏差。\n",
    "2. 标签平滑和一致性 (Label Smoothing and Consistency)\n",
    "在真实的医疗数据中，不同图像有时会有细微差别。即使是同一个 lesion_id，不同图像上的诊断可能不完全相同。如果可以通过 lesion_id 合并标记，将整个病变组作为一个整体来分析和学习，能够减少因为单个图像的不一致性带来的分类混乱。\n",
    "对于恶性病变，如果一个 lesion_id 被确诊为恶性病变，通过同组中的所有图像来强化模型的学习有助于更精确地捕捉疾病特征。\n",
    "3. 减少数据不平衡问题 (Address Data Imbalance)\n",
    "在医学图像分类中，数据通常会存在类别不平衡（如恶性病例数量少）。通过考虑 lesion_id 分组，可以更有效地处理这种不平衡，因为这使得每个 lesion_id 的所有图像都能一起使用，从而有效扩大恶性样本集。\n",
    "这样还可以减少模型因为良性和恶性样本比例差异大而造成的偏差，使模型的训练更加平衡。\n",
    "4. 提高模型对复杂特征的学习能力\n",
    "恶性病变通常会在一段时间内显示出更复杂或多样的特征表现，通过多张图像结合分析，可以帮助模型学习到这些复杂的特征，这在处理恶性分类任务时特别有价值。\n",
    "使用分组数据，还可以在模型架构中加入多输入模型设计，通过输入多张图像的信息，模型可以捕获到单张图像无法展示的特征，提高对病变分类的整体准确率。\n",
    "5. 模型决策的可解释性 (Model Interpretability)\n",
    "对于实际的临床应用，通过良性或恶性分组信息来判断每张图像的诊断，有助于提高模型决策的可解释性。可以更好地理解为什么某个 lesion_id 被分类为恶性，以及它的每张图像在这个分类中的作用。\n",
    "\n",
    "**如何在 DataLoader 中利用这些信息**\n",
    "在 DataLoader 中，利用良性或恶性病变信息的方式可以是：\n",
    "标签增强：将多个图像合并，并为这些图像统一分配一个标签，如 “该组病变为恶性”。\n",
    "数据分组加载：通过每次加载一个组的图像，确保同一 lesion_id 的多个视角都能参与到模型的学习中。\n",
    "改进的损失函数：在训练时，通过为良性和恶性设置不同的损失函数权重，可以让模型在数据不平衡时有更好的表现。"

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.
